# DZOS: Dynamic Z Offset and Soaking

**Latest: 0.5.01**

## DESCRIPTION:
- Machine learning for z-offset based on user training. DZOS predicts bed movement, nozzle movement and sensor drift. DZOS will also soak the bed/probe based on print size.

## GOAL:
1. Solve the SV08 Z issues.
2. Dynamic Z offset based on current state of machine.
3. Dynamic pre-print soak time based on realtime size of print.

## DISCLAIMER:
1. This is a klipper script. If any of the documentation steps are unclear, this isn't something intended for you.
2. Supports stock SV08 klipper and SV08 mainline.
