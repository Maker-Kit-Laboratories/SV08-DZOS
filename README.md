# DZOS: Dynamic Z Offset and Soaking

**Latest: 0.2.00**

## GOAL:
1. Solve the SV08 bed and Z issues.
2. Dynamic Z offset based on current state of bed.
3. Dynamic pre-print soak time based on realtime bed sampling and size/duration of initial X layers.

## DISCLAIMER:
1. This is an early script, use your best judgment if it's right for you.
2. Supports stock SV08 klipper and SV08 mainline.
3. Currently automatic soaking is working but early.
